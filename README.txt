C#

This is a repository of notable projects made while I was at Coding Dojo Seattle from May through September 2019.
These were all initially made while I was active in the C# section of the Coding Dojo cirriculum.
Some files will continue to have additional commits pushed. Please see individual commit comments for details.

All projects contained in this repository are written in C#. The web applications are built on ASP.NET.
They also all employ basic CRUD commands (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manipulate data in a  database.
Below is a list of the projects in this repository, along with a short description beyond the above details.

    - ASPNetProject
        An empty web application used to practice setting up ASP.NET and to experiment with defaults.

    - DojoSurvey
        A web application that collects survey data about a user in an HTML form and stores it in a database.
        Served as a place to learn and practice the use of Viewbags to pass data

    - Escape_Room_RPG
        A console-based choose-your-own-adventure style RPG in which the user guesses which items will unlock doors.
        Featured randomized selections from lists of items, making the game different each time it runs.
        Opportunity to collaborate with a small team to produce a functioning product in under 6 hours.

    - FirstCSharp
        A console application that writes a line to the console. The obligatory "hello world" project. 

    - FormSubmission
        A web application that accepts user data through an HTML form against validations.

    - Hungry_Ninja
        A console application that randomly selects food items from a list for the ninja object to eat.
        Each food item has a calorie score and the ninja is "full" once a given calorie total is met.
        After the ninja consumes each food item, the application checks to see if the ninja is full.
        The ninja eats until full and the application writes a line to the console for each food item eaten.

    - fundamentals_I
        A console application that demonstrates algorithmic principles.
        Created as practice for both algorithms and writing in C#.
    
    - puzzles
        A console application that demonstrates more advanced algorithmic principles.
        Created as further practice with algorithms and C#.
